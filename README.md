# Write and Read Student Records (C++)

A simple C++ program that prompts the user to enter student names and grades, writes them to a text file (`grades.txt`), and then reads and displays the file content. This project is Part 2 of a two-part project that builds on writing student names to a file.

## Description

The program asks the user to enter:
- Name of each student
- Corresponding grade

It then:
- Writes the student names and grades to a file called `grades.txt`
- Reads the file and displays the stored records on the console

This project is useful for learning:
- File handling with `ofstream` and `ifstream`
- Reading and writing structured data
- Loops and user input
- Basic C++ syntax

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC, or Dev-C++)
- Works on Windows, Linux, or macOS

### Installing

1. Clone the repository or download the `.cpp` file.
2. Open it in your preferred IDE (Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or VSCode) or text editor.



### Executing Program

To compile and run using **g++**:

```bash
g++ write_read_records.cpp -o write_read_records
./write_read_records

```
